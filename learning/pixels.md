# Pixels

1 pixel is roughly the size of a period (.) in 12pt font on a standard screen — it's the smallest
  addressable unit your display can render, typically around 0.26mm on a 96 DPI monitor.

  Practical mental anchors for design engineering:
  - 1px = a hairline border, barely visible
  - 4-8px = comfortable spacing between inline elements (like icon + text)
  - 16px = default browser font size, also a great base unit (1rem) (this is vertical height of a line of text)
  - 44px = minimum touch target size (Apple's guideline for tappable areas)
  - 375px wide = iPhone SE/mini viewport (good "small screen" baseline)
  - 410x648px = roughly a mobile screen in portrait, think "hand-sized rectangle" (this is the widthxheight of a mobile screen in portrait)



  Quick trick: Your thumb tip is ~40-50px wide on a phone screen—so when you see dimensions like 410px,
  imagine fitting about 8-10 thumb-widths across.
