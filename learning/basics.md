# Basics

html is the markup language for the web.
padding is the space between the content and the border.
margin is the space outside the border.
and element is the basic building block of the web.

component is a reusable piece of code that can be used to build the web.
a border is a line that surrounds the content of an element.

HTML is the structure of the page. 
Javascript determines the behavior of the page.
Through CSS (cascading style sheets), you can style how the HTML elements look (colours, spacing, sizes, fonts, etc.)
A css class is what you attach to an HTML element to style it. 

Example: <div class="box"> (this is the HTML element) and the class is "box"
CSS class:
.box {
    background-color: red;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
}

<div class="box">Hello</div>

This will make the div with the class "box" have a red background, 100px width, and 100px height.

Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework bundled with different classes to style HTML elements.
For example- flex, grid, etc.
using the grid utilty tuns an element into a grid container with controllable rows and columns.
the flex utility/class turns an element into a flex container where items can arranged in a row or column.
